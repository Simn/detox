  "releasenote": "Many improvements to widgets, see git history. Booleans used in attributes must now be explicitly declared, but you can now do `<div dtx-show='title.length>0'>$title</div>`.  Also changed the way it finds relevant elements, so performance will be improved, it is less error prone (and unit tests to prove it), and there is now no pollution of your HTML with `data-dtx-id` attributes.  See Github commits for more info.",
