	<description>A simple library that eases DOM work in haxe.  It aims to be similar to jQuery, but more haxe-like, and hopefully one day portable to targets other than client side js.</description>
	<version name="0.7.0.0">Added many more unit tests.  These functions now work reliably cross browser: Element Manipulation, Traversing, DOM Manipulation, Collections, Widgets.  Event Management mostly works in Firefox / Webkit, though is broken in IE.  This version fixes many bugs, and introduces some changes to the API.  See the README on Github for more details.  Demos also on Github.</version>
